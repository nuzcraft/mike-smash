## Getting Started

- Install love from https://love2d.org/
- Follow the Getting Started Page here: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started
  - definitely add the directly to the system PATH so we can run it from the command line
- running the command `love path-to-folder` seems to work well
  - `love ../mike-smash/` is what I'm using from my bash terminal that I use for git
- https://sheepolution.com/learn/book/bonus/vscode specifically to set up VS Code debugging
  - there is a whole section at the botton for setting up builds using the `makelove` python package. You might need to `pip install setuptools` as well
  - if you don't want to use the task in vscode, the command is `makelove --config make_all.toml`
